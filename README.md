## 🎯 Objective
Build ultra-cheap educational robotics platform for schools/NGOs, controllable by SBCs (Single Board Computers) and Controllers. See the about video, [click here.](https://github.com/hugorteixeira/educo/raw/refs/heads/main/about_educo.mp4) 

## 📹 Current Demo
Basic movement via Arduino + potentiometer. See the [video demo.](https://github.com/hugorteixeira/educo/raw/refs/heads/main/demo_arduino.mp4)
