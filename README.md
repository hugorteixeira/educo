# EduCO
Low cost robot and AI integrations (pending). Play with Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi or Orange Pi.

![Demo](educo_2.png)

## 🎯 Objective
Build ultra-cheap educational robotics platform for schools/NGOs, controllable by SBCs (Single Board Computers) and Controllers. See the about video, [click here.](https://github.com/hugorteixeira/educo/raw/refs/heads/main/about_educo.mp4) 

## 📹 Current Demo
Basic movement via Arduino + potentiometer. See the [video demo.](https://github.com/hugorteixeira/educo/raw/refs/heads/main/demo_arduino.mp4)

- ✅ AI Vision (it can see and move, but badly)
- 🔄 Fine tuning of a VLA model is necessary
- 🔄 Open web remote control with SSL (planned)
- 🔄 Phosphobot integration
- 📋 Voice interaction (planned)
- 📋 HuggingFace Spaces Setup (planned)

## 💡 Credits (pending)

This project was started in Sao Paulo at the HuggingFace LeRobot Hackhaton 2025.
